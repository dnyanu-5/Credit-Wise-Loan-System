# CreditWise Loan System

An intelligent Machine Learning–based system to predict **credit card loan approval**
using applicant financial, demographic, and credit-related data.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
SecureTrust Bank processes hundreds of loan applications daily using a
manual verification process that is time-consuming, biased, and inconsistent.

The goal of this project is to build a **Machine Learning–based loan approval system**
that can automatically predict whether a loan should be **Approved (1)** or
**Rejected (0)** before final human verification.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Automate loan approval decisions
- Reduce rejection of good customers
- Reduce approval of high-risk customers
- Support faster and unbiased decision-making


## 📊 Dataset Description
Each row represents a loan applicant with attributes such as:
- Applicant_Income
- Coapplicant_Income
- Credit_Score
- Employment_Status
- Existing_Loans
- DTI_Ratio
- Savings
- Loan_Amount
- Loan_Term
- Loan_Purpose
- Property_Area  
- **Target:** `Loan_Approved` (1 = Approved, 0 = Rejected)

> Dataset is included for **academic demonstration purposes only**.

## 🤖 Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

### Logistic Regression (Final Model)
- Higher accuracy
- Better precision and recall
- More reliable classification performance

✔ **Logistic Regression was selected as the final model**

---

## 🏆 Final Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model effectively predicts loan approval outcomes
based on applicant financial and demographic features.

This system can help SecureTrust Bank:
- Reduce manual verification effort
- Minimize biased decision-making
- Lower financial risk from incorrect approvals

The model serves as a **decision-support system** prior to final human review.
